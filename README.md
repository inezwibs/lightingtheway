Helping College Students Learn about and Act on Title IX Harrassment Protections at Schools

This is an Android app prototype created for my first Android course. 

The app aims to provide a student with a straightforward and consolidated way to learn more about how to respond to harrassment on 
college campuses. Many Title IX information is scattered across individual campuses while this app aims to provide contact information
from a single app. 

The app is in its beginning stages and is an example of work completed after two months.
