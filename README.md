Helping college students learn about and act on Title IX Harrassment Protections at Schools

This is an Android app prototype created for my first Android course. 

The app aims to provide a student with a straightforward and consolidated way to learn more about how to respond to harrassment on college campuses. Many Title IX information are scattered across individual campus sites. This app aims to consolidate information in a single app. 

The app is in its beginning stages and is an example of work completed after two months.
